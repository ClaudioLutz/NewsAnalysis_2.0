## Technique Sessions

### First Principles Thinking - 15 minutes

**Description:** Breaking down the problem to fundamental truths and building up from there

**Ideas Generated:**

1. **Core Element Identification:** System prompts are the atomic unit that needs centralization
2. **Discovery Problem:** Prompts are hard to find because they're embedded across 7 different Python files
3. **Current State Analysis:** Discovered prompts scattered in:
   - `summarizer.py` - hardcoded system prompt
   - `gpt_deduplication.py` - clustering prompt
   - `german_rating_formatter.py` - DUPLICATES rating prompt already in language_config!
   - `filter.py` - classification prompt + creditreform system prompt builder
   - `cross_run_deduplication.py` - dedup prompt
   - `incremental_digest.py` - uses language_config methods
   - `analyzer.py` - uses language_config methods
4. **Existing Foundation:** `language_config.py` already has partial centralization but mixes language switching with prompt management
5. **Architectural Decision:** Create separate PromptLibrary/PromptRegistry class to maintain separation of concerns

**Insights Discovered:**
- The real problem isn't just organization - it's discoverability
- Partial centralization already exists but responsibility is mixed
- Duplication exists (german_rating_formatter duplicates language_config prompt)
- About 40% of prompts are already centralized, 60% scattered

**Notable Connections:**
- LanguageConfig should focus on language switching
- PromptLibrary should focus on prompt management
- These two concerns should work together but remain separate

### Morphological Analysis - 20 minutes

**Description:** Systematically exploring all design dimensions to make informed architectural decisions

**Ideas Generated:**

1. **Organizational Structure:** Pipeline stage organization (filtering, deduplication, analysis, formatting, digest)
2. **Access Pattern:** Method-based access following existing patterns: `prompt_lib.filtering.classification_prompt(topic)`
3. **Language Integration:** PromptLibrary accepts LanguageConfig to return language-appropriate prompts
4. **Storage Format:** YAML configuration files for accessibility to non-developers
5. **Parameterization:** Simple Python string templates using `{variable}` syntax
6. **File Organization:** One YAML file per pipeline stage in `config/prompts/` directory
7. **Migration Strategy:** Big Bang - migrate all prompts at once for clean transition

**Insights Discovered:**
- Each design dimension has trade-offs between simplicity and power
- Matching existing code patterns (language_config) improves adoption
- YAML strikes balance between accessibility and structure
- Pipeline stage organization maps to developer mental model
- Method-based access provides best IDE support (autocomplete, type hints)

**Notable Connections:**
- Organization by pipeline stage mirrors the actual codebase structure
- Simpler parameterization (string templates vs Jinja2) reduces complexity without losing flexibility
- One-file-per-stage balances granularity with manageability

---

### Forced Relationships - 10 minutes

**Description:** Connecting PromptLibrary concept with unrelated domains to spark innovative features

**Ideas Generated:**

1. **Documentation System Integration:** Add rich metadata to each prompt in YAML
   - Description of what the prompt does
   - Purpose and context of use
   - Parameter specifications (name, required, description)
   - Example usage code
   - Cost estimates per API call

**Insights Discovered:**
- Self-documenting prompts reduce onboarding friction
- Documentation in YAML keeps information close to the source
- Rich metadata enables future tooling (cost analysis, usage tracking)

**Notable Connections:**
- Documentation makes the library discoverable AND understandable
- Example usage reduces "how do I use this?" questions
- Cost estimates help with budget planning and optimization

   - Transformative potential: Make system truly international
   - Challenges to overcome: Translation quality, cultural context, maintenance overhead

### Insights & Learnings
*Key realizations from the session*

- **Discoverability drives design:** The core problem wasn't organization but finding prompts when needed. This insight shaped every subsequent decision.
- **Existing patterns matter:** Matching the existing language_config pattern improved adoption likelihood and reduced cognitive load.
- **Simplicity over power:** Simple string templates beat Jinja2 templates because they're "good enough" without added complexity.
- **Documentation is feature one:** Self-documenting YAML with rich metadata turns the library from code to knowledge base.
- **Big Bang is brave but clean:** While risky, migrating all at once avoids long-term technical debt of dual systems.
- **Separation of concerns unlocks flexibility:** PromptLibrary + LanguageConfig working together beats mixing responsibilities in one class.

## Action Planning

### Top 3 Priority Ideas

#### #1 Priority: Create PromptLibrary Architecture & Core Implementation

- **Rationale:** Foundation must be solid before any prompts can migrate. This is the enabling infrastructure.
- **Next steps:**
  1. Create `news_pipeline/prompt_library.py` with main PromptLibrary class
  2. Design stage-specific subclasses (FilteringPrompts, DeduplicationPrompts, etc.)
  3. Implement YAML loading and caching mechanism
  4. Add language integration with LanguageConfig
  5. Create example prompt to validate architecture
- **Resources needed:** 
  - Python development skills
  - Understanding of current codebase structure
  - Access to modify news_pipeline module
- **Timeline:** 1-2 days for core architecture

#### #2 Priority: Create YAML Files with Documented Prompts

- **Rationale:** Extract all current prompts into well-documented YAML files. This makes the invisible visible.
- **Next steps:**
  1. Create `config/prompts/` directory
  2. Extract prompts from each of 7 source files
  3. Create YAML files: filtering.yaml, deduplication.yaml, analysis.yaml, formatting.yaml, digest.yaml
  4. Add rich documentation for each prompt (description, parameters, usage examples, cost estimates)
  5. Validate YAML syntax and completeness
  6. Remove duplicate prompts (e.g., german_rating_formatter duplicate)
- **Resources needed:**
  - Access to all source files
  - YAML editing/validation
  - Documentation writing time
  - Domain knowledge for cost estimates
- **Timeline:** 2-3 days for extraction and documentation
