# Fix: Rating Report Generation Failure

## Status: COMPLETED ✅
**Date:** 2025-10-06  
**Priority:** High  
**Impact:** Critical - Rating reports weren't being generated

## Issue Summary

The rating report generation was failing silently during pipeline runs. The log showed:
```
2025-10-06 08:33:29,025 - news_pipeline.german_rating_formatter - INFO - format_to_german_markdown:78 - No articles found in digest - skipping German rating report generation
```

Despite 3 articles being successfully processed (selected, scraped, and summarized).

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by incomplete migration from direct `LanguageConfig` method calls to `PromptLibrary`:

1. **`incremental_digest.py`** was calling non-existent methods:
   - `language_config.get_partial_digest_prompt(topic)` (Line 176)
   - `language_config.get_merge_digests_prompt(topic)` (Line 276)

2. **`enhanced_analyzer.py`** was calling:
   - `language_config.get_executive_summary_prompt()` (Line 208)

3. These methods don't exist in `LanguageConfig` - they should use `PromptLibrary.get_fragment()` instead

4. The failures caused:
   - Partial digest generation to fail → empty `creditreform_insights` topic digest
   - Executive summary generation to fail
   - Article count in digest JSON to show 0
   - German rating formatter to skip report generation

## Solution Implemented

### Files Modified

#### 1. `news_pipeline/incremental_digest.py`
- Added `PromptLibrary` initialization in `__init__`
- Changed `language_config.get_partial_digest_prompt(topic)` → `self.prompt_lib.get_fragment('digest', 'partial_digest_generation')`
- Changed `language_config.get_merge_digests_prompt(topic)` → `self.prompt_lib.get_fragment('digest', 'merge_digests')`

#### 2. `news_pipeline/enhanced_analyzer.py`
- Changed `language_config.get_executive_summary_prompt()` → `prompt_lib.get_fragment('digest', 'executive_summary')`
- Added inline imports for `PromptLibrary` and `LanguageConfig` in the method

## Testing Required

Run the pipeline to verify:
```bash
python news_analyzer.py
```

Expected results:
1. Digest JSON should have complete topic digests with article counts
2. Executive summary should generate successfully
3. German rating report should be created in `rating_reports/`

## Impact

- **Before:** Silent failures caused incomplete digests and no rating reports
- **After:** Full digest generation with proper rating report output

## Notes

- This fix maintains the German-only output approach (PoC requirement)
- `LanguageConfig` is kept simple and focused on language selection only
- All prompt management goes through `PromptLibrary` system
- The fix addresses backward compatibility concerns mentioned in previous stories
