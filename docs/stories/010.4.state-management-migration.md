# Story 010.4: State Management and Migration

## Status
Complete

## Story
**As a** Developer implementing cost optimization,
**I want** to clear cached digest state and handle schema migration gracefully,
**so that** the system transitions cleanly from the old schema (with bullets/executive_summary) to the new schema without errors or crashes.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All cached digest state cleared before first run with new schema
2. Incremental merge handles graceful degradation if old state encountered
3. Documentation added: "Digest state cleared for schema migration"
4. First run with new schema completes successfully
5. Subsequent incremental updates work correctly
6. No schema validation errors in logs

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Identify digest state storage mechanism (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Locate digest state files or database tables
  - [ ] Document current state storage pattern
  - [ ] Identify state file naming conventions
  - [ ] Determine state cleanup approach

- [ ] Task 2: Create state cleanup script (AC: 1, 3)
  - [ ] Create script to identify all digest state files
  - [ ] Add safety confirmation before deletion
  - [ ] Log state cleanup actions
  - [ ] Document cleanup in migration notes

- [ ] Task 3: Execute state cleanup (AC: 1, 3)
  - [ ] Backup existing state (optional safety measure)
  - [ ] Execute state cleanup script
  - [ ] Verify all old state removed
  - [ ] Document cleanup completion with timestamp

- [ ] Task 4: Add backward compatibility handling (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Update code to handle missing bullets field gracefully
  - [ ] Add fallback logic for old format digests
  - [ ] Test with mixed format scenarios
  - [ ] Log warnings if old format encountered

- [ ] Task 5: Test first run with new schema (AC: 4, 6)
  - [ ] Run full pipeline after state cleanup
  - [ ] Verify digest generation completes
  - [ ] Check logs for schema validation errors
  - [ ] Confirm no bullets/executive_summary in output

- [ ] Task 6: Test incremental updates (AC: 5, 6)
  - [ ] Run pipeline second time (incremental mode)
  - [ ] Verify incremental merge works correctly
  - [ ] Confirm no errors with new format merging
  - [ ] Validate final output consistency

## Dev Notes

### Prerequisites

**MUST COMPLETE FIRST:**
- ✅ Story 010.1 (Validation and Code Reference Discovery)
- ✅ Story 010.2 (Remove Executive Summary Generation)
- ✅ Story 010.3 (Remove Digest Bullets from Schema)

Story 3 completion is REQUIRED because:
- New schemas must be in place before state migration
- State cleanup ensures clean start with new format
- Prevents mixed format issues during migration

### Context from Cost Optimization Analysis

**Source Document:** docs/cost_optimization_analysis.md

**Why State Management Matters:**

**Identified Risk:** Backward Compatibility with Cached Digests
- Old cached digests have bullets and executive_summary fields
- New schema doesn't expect these fields
- Incremental merge might fail with mixed formats

**Mitigation Strategy:**
1. Clear all digest state before first run (clean slate)
2. Add graceful handling for old format (safety net)
3. Document migration process (transparency)

**From Analysis:**
> "Solution: Clear all digest state before first run"
> "Test scenario: Ensure old format + new format doesn't crash"

### Project Structure

**Source:** docs/architecture.md

**State Management Files:**

Based on existing codebase analysis:
```
news_pipeline/
├── state_manager.py          # Existing state management patterns
├── incremental_digest.py     # Incremental merge logic

# State storage (likely patterns):
.digest_state_*               # File-based state
OR
news.db (digest_state table)  # Database-based state
```

**Files to Check:**
1. **news_pipeline/state_manager.py** - Existing state management patterns
2. **news_pipeline/incremental_digest.py** - Merge logic that needs backward compatibility
3. **Project root** - Look for .digest_state_* files
4. **news.db** - Check for digest_state table

### State Storage Investigation

**Story 1 Should Have Identified:**
- Location of digest state storage
- File patterns or database tables
- State lifecycle (creation, update, cleanup)

**Expected Patterns:**

**If File-Based:**
```bash
# Likely patterns
.digest_state_YYYY-MM-DD.json
.digest_state_*.json
digest_state/YYYY-MM-DD.json
```

**If Database-Based:**
```sql
-- Expected table structure
CREATE TABLE digest_state (
    date TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    digest_data TEXT,  -- JSON with bullets/executive_summary
    created_at TEXT,
    updated_at TEXT
);
```

### State Cleanup Implementation

**Approach 1: File-Based State**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/clear_digest_state.sh

echo "=== Digest State Migration Cleanup ==="
echo "This will remove all cached digest state to enable schema migration"
echo ""

# Find state files
STATE_FILES=$(find . -name ".digest_state_*" -o -name "digest_state_*.json")

if [ -z "$STATE_FILES" ]; then
    echo "No digest state files found. Nothing to clean."
    exit 0
fi

echo "Found state files:"
echo "$STATE_FILES"
echo ""

read -p "Delete these files? (yes/no): " CONFIRM

if [ "$CONFIRM" == "yes" ]; then
    find . -name ".digest_state_*" -o -name "digest_state_*.json" -exec rm {} \;
    echo "✓ Digest state cleared"
    echo "✓ Migration preparation complete"
    echo "Timestamp: $(date -Iseconds)"
else
    echo "Cleanup cancelled"
    exit 1
fi
```

**Approach 2: Database-Based State**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/clear_digest_state.sh

echo "=== Digest State Migration Cleanup ==="
echo "This will clear digest_state table for schema migration"
echo ""

# Show current state
echo "Current digest state entries:"
sqlite3 news.db "SELECT date, length(digest_data) as size FROM digest_state;"

echo ""
read -p "Delete all digest state? (yes/no): " CONFIRM

if [ "$CONFIRM" == "yes" ]; then
    sqlite3 news.db "DELETE FROM digest_state;"
    echo "✓ Digest state cleared from database"
    echo "✓ Migration preparation complete"
    echo "Timestamp: $(date -Iseconds)"
else
    echo "Cleanup cancelled"
    exit 1
fi
```

### Backward Compatibility Code

**Location:** news_pipeline/incremental_digest.py

**Add Graceful Handling:**

```python
def merge_digests(old_digest, new_digest):
    """
    Merge old and new digest data, handling schema changes gracefully.
    
    Note: Old format may include 'bullets' and 'executive_summary' fields
    that are no longer used in new schema. These fields are silently dropped.
    """
    merged = {}
    
    # Core fields (always present)
    merged['headline'] = new_digest.get('headline', old_digest.get('headline', ''))
    merged['why_it_matters'] = new_digest.get('why_it_matters', old_digest.get('why_it_matters', ''))
    merged['sources'] = new_digest.get('sources', old_digest.get('sources', []))
    
    # Handle old format gracefully (bullets and executive_summary)
    # These fields are ignored in new schema
    if 'bullets' in old_digest:
        logger.warning(f"Old format detected: digest contains 'bullets' field (ignored)")
    if 'executive_summary' in old_digest:
        logger.warning(f"Old format detected: digest contains 'executive_summary' field (ignored)")
    
    return merged
```

### Migration Documentation

**Create:** docs/migration-notes/schema-migration-2025-10-05.md

```markdown
# Digest Schema Migration - 2025-10-05

## Overview
Migration from schema with bullets/executive_summary to simplified schema.

## Changes Made
1. Removed digest bullets field from schemas
2. Removed executive summary generation
3. Cleared all cached digest state

## State Cleanup
- Date: 2025-10-05
- Method: [File deletion / Database DELETE]
- Files removed: [List files]
- Reason: Ensure clean migration to new schema

## Backward Compatibility
- Code updated to handle old format gracefully
- Warnings logged if old format encountered
- Old fields silently dropped during merge

## Verification
- First run with new schema: [Date/Time] ✓
- Incremental merge test: [Date/Time] ✓
- No schema errors in logs: ✓

## Rollback Plan
If issues arise:
1. git revert [commit hashes from Stories 2-3]
2. Restore state from backup (if created)
3. Pipeline reverts to old behavior
```

### Testing

**Testing Standards:**
**Source:** docs/architecture.md - Testing Strategy section

**Testing Approach:**

1. **State Cleanup Verification:**
```bash
# Before cleanup
ls -la .digest_state_* 2>/dev/null | wc -l
# OR
sqlite3 news.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM digest_state;"

# After cleanup
ls -la .digest_state_* 2>/dev/null | wc -l  # Should be 0
# OR
sqlite3 news.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM digest_state;"  # Should be 0
```

2. **First Run Test:**
```bash
# Run pipeline after state cleanup
python news_analyzer.py

# Verify success
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "✓ First run with new schema successful"
fi

# Check logs for errors
grep -i "error\|exception" logs/latest.log
# Should find no schema-related errors
```

3. **Incremental Update Test:**
```bash
# Run pipeline again (should trigger incremental merge)
python news_analyzer.py

# Verify incremental merge works
grep -i "incremental\|merge" logs/latest.log

# Verify no errors
grep -i "error\|exception" logs/latest.log
```

4. **Backward Compatibility Test:**
```python
# Test old format handling
def test_merge_with_old_format():
    old_digest = {
        "headline": "Old Headline",
        "why_it_matters": "Old explanation",
        "bullets": ["bullet1", "bullet2"],  # Old format
        "executive_summary": "Summary text",  # Old format
        "sources": ["source1.com"]
    }
    
    new_digest = {
        "headline": "New Headline",
        "why_it_matters": "New explanation",
        "sources": ["source2.com"]
    }
    
    # Should not crash
    merged = merge_digests(old_digest, new_digest)
    
    # Should use new format
    assert 'bullets' not in merged
    assert 'executive_summary' not in merged
    assert merged['headline'] == "New Headline"
```

### Risk Mitigation

**Source:** docs/cost_optimization_analysis.md - Risk Assessment

**Identified Risks & Mitigations:**

1. **Data Loss:**
   - Risk: Clearing state loses work
   - Mitigation: State regenerates automatically on next run
   - Safety: Optional backup before cleanup

2. **Mixed Format Crashes:**
   - Risk: Old format + new format = error
   - Mitigation: Backward compatibility code
   - Testing: Explicit mixed format tests

3. **Incomplete Cleanup:**
   - Risk: Some state files missed
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive search patterns
   - Verification: Double-check cleanup complete
