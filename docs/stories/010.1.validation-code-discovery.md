# Story 010.1: Validation and Code Reference Discovery

## Status
Complete

## Story
**As a** Developer preparing for cost optimization,
**I want** to identify all code locations that reference `digest.bullets` or `executive_summary` fields,
**so that** I can confidently remove these fields knowing exactly what code might be affected and verify our assumptions about their non-usage.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All references to `digest.bullets` found in Python code across the entire codebase
2. All references to `executive_summary` found in Python code across the entire codebase
3. Database schema checked for any digest storage columns or tables
4. All JSON schema definition locations identified (analyzer.py, incremental_digest.py, language_config.py)
5. Documentation created listing all findings with file paths and line numbers
6. Zero Python code accessing these fields (except generation) confirmed through systematic search

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Search for digest.bullets references (AC: 1, 6)
  - [x] Run grep search: `grep -rn "\.bullets\|digest.*bullets\|bullets.*digest" news_pipeline/`
  - [x] Run grep search in templates: `grep -rn "\.bullets\|digest.*bullets" templates/`

## Dev Notes

### Context from Cost Optimization Analysis

**Source Document:** docs/cost_optimization_analysis.md

This story validates the assumptions made in the cost optimization analysis before proceeding with code modifications. The analysis identified:

**Key Findings to Validate:**
- Digest bullets are generated (analyzer.py, incremental_digest.py) but never used in final output
- Executive summary is generated (analyzer.py) but never appears in final German rating report
- Only `headline` and `why_it_matters` from digests reach final output via templates/daily_digest.md.j2
- Article-level key_points are generated separately in german_rating_formatter.py (these ARE used)

**Critical Validation Points:**
1. **Template Usage:** templates/daily_digest.md.j2 lines 31-34 use only digest.headline and digest.why_it_matters
2. **Schema Definitions:**
   - analyzer.py (lines 126-137): response_schema includes bullets field
   - incremental_digest.py (lines 169-177): merge_schema includes bullets field
   - language_config.py: German/English configs request "4-6 wichtige Erkenntnisse"
3. **Executive Summary Dependency:** Line 349 of analyzer.py shows executive_summary generation CONSUMES digest bullets
4. **No Database Storage:** Digest data should be transient (not stored in database tables)

### Project Structure

**Source:** docs/architecture.md (Brownfield Enhancement Architecture)

**Relevant Directories:**
```
news_pipeline/
├── analyzer.py                 # Contains digest generation with bullets
├── incremental_digest.py       # Contains merge logic with bullets
├── language_config.py          # Contains prompt configurations
├── german_rating_formatter.py  # Generates article key_points (separate from digest bullets)
└── utils.py                    # Logging utilities

templates/
└── daily_digest.md.j2          # Final output template (uses headline/why_it_matters only)

scripts/
└── (various utility scripts)
```

**Key Files to Analyze:**
1. **news_pipeline/analyzer.py**
   - Lines 126-137: Digest response schema definition
   - Line 349: Executive summary generation consuming bullets
   - Search for all references to `bullets` field

2. **news_pipeline/incremental_digest.py**
   - Lines 169-177: Merge schema definition
   - Search for merge logic handling bullets

3. **news_pipeline/language_config.py**
   - German config: "4-6 wichtige Erkenntnisse und Entwicklungen"
   - English config: "4-6 key insights and developments"
   - Any other language configs

4. **news_pipeline/german_rating_formatter.py**
   - Lines 146-199: Article key_points generation (separate from digest bullets)
   - Verify this is the ONLY key points generation reaching final output
   - Confirm no consumption of digest.bullets

5. **templates/daily_digest.md.j2**
   - Lines 31-34: Template usage of digest fields
   - Confirm no reference to digest.bullets
   - Verify only headline and why_it_matters used

### Search Commands to Execute

**For digest.bullets references:**
```bash
# Search Python code
grep -rn "\.bullets\|digest.*bullets\|bullets.*digest" news_pipeline/ templates/

# Search more broadly
grep -rn "bullets" news_pipeline/ templates/ scripts/
```

**For executive_summary references:**
```bash
# Search Python code
grep -rn "executive_summary" news_pipeline/ templates/ scripts/
```

**For database schema:**
```bash
# Check all tables
sqlite3 news.db "SELECT sql FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table';"

# Check for digest-related tables
sqlite3 news.db "SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name LIKE '%digest%';"
```

### Expected Findings

**Based on Cost Optimization Analysis:**

**digest.bullets Expected References:**
- ✅ analyzer.py line ~130: Schema definition (generation)
- ✅ incremental_digest.py line ~171: Schema definition (generation)
- ✅ language_config.py: Prompt text requesting bullets
- ❌ templates/daily_digest.md.j2: Should have ZERO references
- ❌ german_rating_formatter.py: Should have ZERO references (uses own key_points generation)

**executive_summary Expected References:**
- ✅ analyzer.py: Function create_executive_summary() and its call
- ✅ analyzer.py line 349: Consumes digest bullets as input
- ❌ templates/daily_digest.md.j2: Should have ZERO references
- ❌ Any other consumption code: Should have ZERO references

**Database Schema Expected:**
- Tables: articles, summaries, digest_state, article_clusters (from architecture.md)
- NO columns for persistent digest.bullets storage
- NO columns for persistent executive_summary storage
- Digests should be generated on-demand, not stored

### Risk Assessment

**From Cost Optimization Analysis - Advanced Elicitation:**

**HIGH RISK Issues:**
- Hidden Python consumers not found by template search
- Executive summary dependency on bullets (line 349)
- JSON schema strict enforcement uncertainty

**MEDIUM RISK Issues:**
- Backward compatibility with cached digests
- Incremental merge with mixed formats
- Atomic schema updates across multiple files

**Validation Mitigations:**
- This story systematically searches ALL Python code
- Identifies executive summary dependency for proper sequencing
- Confirms database has no persistent storage
