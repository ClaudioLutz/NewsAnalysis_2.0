# Story: Integrate Cross-Run Deduplication into Pipeline

**Epic:** Cross-Run Topic Deduplication Enhancement
**Story ID:** epic-cross-run-dedup-004
**Status:** Draft
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 hours
**Depends On:** epic-cross-run-dedup-003 (CrossRunTopicDeduplicator must be complete)

## Story

As a **Pipeline Orchestrator**
I need **to integrate Step 3.1 cross-run deduplication into the existing pipeline flow**
So that **the system automatically filters duplicate topics before digest generation**

## Acceptance Criteria

### Pipeline Integration
- [ ] Modify `news_pipeline/enhanced_analyzer.py` to integrate Step 3.1
- [ ] CrossRunTopicDeduplicator called after summarization, before digest generation
- [ ] Integration point: Between ArticleSummarizer (Step 4) and digest creation
- [ ] Import statement added for CrossRunTopicDeduplicator

### Execution Flow
- [ ] Deduplicator instantiated with same db_path as other components
- [ ] Called with current date parameter
- [ ] Results logged and included in digest metadata
- [ ] Duplicate articles excluded from digest generation

### Error Handling & Fallback
- [ ] If Step 3.1 fails, pipeline continues with all articles (no filtering)
- [ ] Failure logged clearly but doesn't crash pipeline
- [ ] Existing functionality preserved on component failure
- [ ] Graceful degradation maintains backward compatibility

### Filtering Logic
- [ ] Only articles with topic_already_covered=FALSE passed to digest generation
- [ ] Filtered article count included in digest metadata
- [ ] Logging shows before/after article counts

### Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Step 3.1 execution time logged
- [ ] Token usage logged if available from deduplicator
- [ ] Overall pipeline time impact measured and logged

## Dev Notes

### Reference Files
- Architecture: `docs/architecture.md` - Component Architecture and Pipeline Integration sections
- Main Integration Point: `news_pipeline/enhanced_analyzer.py` (generate_incremental_daily_digests method)
- Pattern Reference: `news_pipeline/gpt_deduplication.py` integration in pipeline

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Integration Location
```
news_pipeline/enhanced_analyzer.py
```

#### Modification Points

1. **Add Import Statement:**
```python
from news_pipeline.cross_run_deduplication import CrossRunTopicDeduplicator
```

2. **Modify generate_incremental_daily_digests Method:**

Add Step 3.1 call before digest generation:

```python
def generate_incremental_daily_digests(
    self, 
    topics: Optional[List[str]] = None, 
    date: Optional[str] = None
) -> Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Generate daily digests using incremental processing.
    Enhanced with cross-run topic deduplication (Step 3.1).
    """
    if date is None:
        date = datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
    
    self.logger.info(f"Starting digest generation for {date}")
    
    # NEW: Step 3.1 - Cross-Run Topic Deduplication
    try:
        cross_run_dedup = CrossRunTopicDeduplicator(self.db_path)
        dedup_results = cross_run_dedup.deduplicate_against_previous_runs(date)
        
        self.logger.info(
            f"Cross-run deduplication complete: "
            f"{dedup_results.get('duplicates_found', 0)} duplicates filtered, "
            f"{dedup_results.get('unique_articles', 0)} unique articles proceeding"
        )
        
    except Exception as e:
        self.logger.warning(
            f"Cross-run deduplication failed (Step 3.1): {e}. "
            f"Continuing with all articles."
        )
        dedup_results = {'error': str(e)}
    
    # Continue with existing digest generation logic...
    # (rest of the method unchanged)
```

3. **Modify Article Query to Respect Filtering:**

Update queries to exclude articles marked as topic_already_covered:

```python
# In methods that query summaries for digest generation
cursor = conn.execute("""
    SELECT s.item_id, s.summary, s.topic, i.title
    FROM summaries s
    JOIN items i ON s.item_id = i.id
    WHERE s.topic = ?
    AND DATE(s.created_at) = ?
    AND s.topic_already_covered = 0  -- NEW: Exclude cross-run duplicates
    ORDER BY s.created_at DESC
""", (topic, date))
```

4. **Add Metadata to Digest Output:**

Include cross-run deduplication statistics in digest metadata:

```python
export_data = {
    'date': date_str,
    'created_at': original_created_at or current_time,
    'generated_at': current_time,
    'executive_summary': executive,
    'trending_topics': trending,
    'topic_digests': digests,
    # NEW: Cross-run deduplication metadata
    'cross_run_dedup_stats': {
        'articles_processed': dedup_results.get('articles_processed', 0),
        'duplicates_filtered': dedup_results.get('duplicates_found', 0),
        'deduplication_rate': dedup_results.get('deduplication_rate', '0.0%')
    }
}
```

### Integration Checklist
1. Import CrossRunTopicDeduplicator at top of file
2. Instantiate deduplicator in generate_incremental_daily_digests
3. Call deduplicate_against_previous_runs before digest generation
4. Handle errors with try-except, log warnings, continue on failure
5. Update summary queries to exclude topic_already_covered articles
6. Add dedup statistics to digest metadata
7. Update logging to show filtering results

### Critical Requirements from Architecture
1. **Integration Point:** After summarization (Step 4), before digest generation (Step 5)
2. **Graceful Degradation:** Pipeline continues if Step 3.1 fails
3. **Backward Compatibility:** Existing pipeline behavior preserved
4. **Logging:** Clear logging of deduplication results
5. **Zero Downtime:** New functionality auto-activates when modules present

### Testing Approach
Manual integration testing:
1. Run full pipeline without new modules - confirm works
2. Add new modules - confirm Step 3.1 executes
3. Run pipeline twice same day - confirm second run filters topics
4. Simulate Step 3.1 failure - confirm pipeline continues
5. Check digest output includes dedup metadata

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Tested: Pipeline works with new modules (Step 3.1 executes)
- [ ] Tested: Multiple same-day runs filter correctly
- [ ] Tested: Pipeline continues on Step 3.1 failure
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns in enhanced_analyzer.py
- [ ] Type hints maintained
- [ ] Docstrings updated
